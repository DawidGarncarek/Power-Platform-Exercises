# Power-Platform-Exercises
This repository contains exercises and projects related to Microsoft Power Platform.
The goal is to learn how to build low-code solutions, automate processes, and analyze data effectively using tools like Power Apps, Power Automate, and Power BI.
It is part of my journey to improve skills in business process automation and data visualization.
